When the surface electrode is used, the energy of EMG signal is mainly concentrated under 1000 Hz. Spectrum distribution between 20–500 Hz, mainly concentrated under 500 Hz, more than 300 Hz significantly weakened. Among them, most of the spectrum is concentrated between 50–150 Hz. The maximum frequency of power spectra varies with muscle, usually between 30–300 Hz.
